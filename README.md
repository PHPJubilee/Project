# PHPJubilee

### *Forgiving technical debt, two weeks at a time*

## What is the Jubilee?

It is fairly common to see this constellation of issues come up in the PHP developer community:

- "I'm not a Junior dev, but I don't know where to start when it comes to contributing to projects."
- "I don't know what projects need what help, or how to find them."
- "I'm still learning PHP. I want to work on an open source project to help learn, but don't know the 'good' from the 'bad'."
- "I have a project that I would like help on, but don't know where to find it."

The group will decide from [a list of PHP projects](https://github.com/PHPJubilee/Project/issues/1) a new project to contribute to every two weeks.

Every two weeks, the org will fork the new repo on github. Everyone that has joined the org will have write access to the forked repo. They will of course also be able to fork it themselves if they want, but particularly because this could be helpful for novice developers that want a way to get their feet wet, development should primarily be from the Org's fork.

Each user will create their own feature branch, the org will create it's own issues list and assign them out, and we will provide the project maintainer with one pull request per issue we close (on our end).

The whole idea of this would be to roll through the PHP community and for one project every two weeks "forgive their technical debt": thus, Jubilee.

## What sort of things will the group try to do?

The kinds of things that we would (primarily) be looking to help with, in order of importance:

1. Helping the project close existing bug issues.
2. Helping to report (and fix if possible) new bug issues.
3. Increasing unit test coverage, and improving the quality of those tests.
4. Ensuring that the code has DocBlock comments so that IDEs can work easily with the project.
5. Identify areas of the project that need to be fixed for best practices & coding style (as specified by the project itself).
