# Sprint Process

S = Start Date
E = End Date

## Start -2 Days

The repository for the project is forked into the PHPJubilee organization.

## S-2 - S

The repository is prepped with all of the custom labels that we will be using, and initial issue reporting can occur. Any issues open in the original repository that we intend to close will be copied at this time.

## S - S+2

The group looks through the codebase and identifies problems or improvements that can be made, creating the issues for them. The Jubilee lead (the person leading that sprint) makes sure they are all labeled.

## S+2

The Jubilee lead gives each open issue at least one label for a team (each team will have a label in the repository). Each team should try to close all of their issues before moving on to helping other teams, if possible.

## S+2 - S+10

Development! We all buckle in and try to make as much improvement, and forgive as much technical debt as we can.

## S+10 - E

Pull requests are made from each feature branch into the original project. Be sure to communicate with the person maintaining the original project if they have notes or changes in the pull request that need to be addressed before the pull request can be merged.
