# Rules For The Jubilees

Below are a list of rules to help promote the core tenets of the project.

- Before a branch can be used for a PR into the original repository, at least **two** other members have to give the branch a :+1: in the relevant issue.
- Until the last two days of the Jubilee, please make sure that everyone gets a chance to finish an issue if they want to. During the last two days, anyone may reassign an issue to themselves if the person working on it won't get it finished in time.
- Be helpful, and answer questions. Any time a member encounters something they don't know, teach them how to do it if you can, don't try to do it for them if possible.
- Respect the wishes of the original repository owner.
